This is an upgraded version of the known RSA encryption. It uses a similar method as RSA,but then encrypts the RSA-encrypted string a bit further into unreadable Unicode. A decrypter is currently in work, but you can also try to write your own decrypter. The encrypt2.py file also outputs the keys, whilst the unicode_dec.py file can convert Unicode signs to the needed decimal numbers.
